# Mid-Term-Project
Predict cancer mortality rates in the USA and explore the most important impact factors
## Project Goal
The goal of my project is to determine which impact factors can have an influence on a the cancer mortality rate in US counties. Additionally, I would also like to look into the cancer incidences in those counties and elaborate if they have the same or different reasons.
## Dataset 
The original data set is offered as a OLS Regression Challange in data.word. (https://data.world/nrippner/ols-regression-challenge)
This data was aggregated from a number of sources including the American Community Survey (census.gov), clinicaltrials.gov, and cancer.gov.
I want to add additional data sets to see if other impact factors are also relevant. Those include manufacturing share by county, UV exposure by county and urban/rural categorisation by county.
## Setup
I plan to do the joining of the data, the cleaning and processing as well as data modelling in Python. 
For data visualization and exploring I want to use Tableau.
